General Information:
The following list of application scenarios was used to derive requirements and evaluate SemTS.
Since these scenarios involve sensitive information from partners across various research and industry projects, the corresponding scenario files use artificial values.
The primary purpose of partially provided code examples is to showcase the applicability and correct usage of SemTS for diverse application scenarios and analytical tasks. They are not intended to provide a comprehensive representation of each use case.

Application Scenarios:
S1:
KnowlEdge (EU Horizon Project - Grant Agreement No 957331)
Description: The project advances human-centered AI for Industry 5.0 through the knowlEdge architecture, a zero-touch framework integrating AI and human feedback across the edge-to-cloud continuum to enhance collaboration, trust, and industrial prosperity.
