# General Information
As the following application scenarios involve sensitive information from partners of multiple research and industry projects, corresponding examples utilize artificial values.
Furthermore the purpose of these examples is to demonstrate the applicability and correct use of SemTS for different application scenarios and analytical tasks. This should not imply a complete representation of each use case.

# Real-World Application Scenarios

# Scenario 1
KnowlEdge (EU Horizon Project - Grant Agreement No 957331)  
**Description:** The project advances human-centered AI for Industry 5.0 through the knowlEdge architecture, a zero-touch framework integrating AI and human feedback across the edge-to-cloud continuum to enhance collaboration, trust, and industrial prosperity.  
**Related References:** https://doi.org/10.3390/systems12020048  
**Use Case:** Unsupervised anomaly detection for process data from blow molding machines.  
**Code example available:** yes  

# Scenario 2
Grinding Beads Wear (German Industry Project)  
**Description:** The project aims to predict the wear behavior of ceramic grinding beads during application processes using artificial intelligence.

**Use Case:** Forecasting of grinding bead wear.  
**Example available:** yes  

# Scenario 3
AI for Animal Welfare (German Industry Project)  
**Description:** The project leverages artificial intelligence to enhance animal welfare in slaughterhouses by developing methods to expand operational animal welfare controls.  
**Related References:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-70893-0_20  
**Use Case:** Object and event detection to classify animal behaviors as well as animal welfare violations.  
**Code example available:** not yet  

# Scenario 4
COMPOSITION (EU Horizon Project - Grant Agreement No 723145)  
**Description:** The project COMPOSITION focuses on optimizing both internal factory processes and inter-company business operations by integrating heterogeneous production data into a unified information management system and enabling secure, efficient data exchange between collaborating companies.  
**Related References:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-58485-9_3  
**Use Case:** Predictive maintenance in industrial production by using sensor data from a reflow oven to anticipate failures and improve operational efficiency.  
**Code example available:** not yet
