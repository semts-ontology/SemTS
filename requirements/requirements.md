| **Knowledge Management** | The ontology should support advanced reuse of analytical details for recommendations.                                                             | Subclasses of `MethodicalKnowledge` inherit from ML-Schema to define details, while also allowing for the assignment of particular concepts available via different vocabularies such as compatible ones from MLSO                                                                 |
| **Knowledge Management** | The ontology should provide a framework to compare generated knowledge through dedicated Knowledge classes.                                       | Class `SegmentRelation`                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Knowledge Management** | The ontology should support the modular enrichment of specific knowledge concepts.                                                                | Use of `skos:Concept`, which allows for the assignment of details from dedicated vocabularies (either semts or external vocabularies such as MLSO)                                                                                          |
| **Knowledge Management** | The ontology should support the definition of explicit model information associated with a particular run of an analysis task.                    | Reuse of ML-Schema                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Knowledge Management** | The ontology should allow for the reference of concrete analysis model instances independent of their level of explainability.                    | Class `ModelInstance` to represent knowledge that is for instance a reference to a pretrained AI model                                                                                                                                     |
