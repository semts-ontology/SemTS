# Interview Template Version 2: Domain Experts

This version is adapted for domain experts to gather insights on their domain-specific knowledge, priorities, and expectations.

---

## 1. General Understanding and Use Cases
- What types of time series data do you analyze in your domain?
- Can you describe specific scenarios or processes where time series data plays a key role?
- What are the common challenges you face when working with time series data?
- How do you currently document or annotate time series data?

---

## 2. Time Series Segment Representation
- How do you identify and define meaningful intervals (e.g., events) within time series data in your domain?
- Are there domain-specific rules or facts associated with time series data?
- What types of insights are commonly associated with time series in your domain (e.g., anomalies, trends, seasonal patterns)?

---

## 3. Knowledge Categorization and Representation
- How do you currently document knowledge about specific time series or subsequences?
- What types of domain-specific information should the ontology represent (e.g., verified facts, expert annotations)?
- Can you provide examples of domain-specific a priori knowledge or rules that should be incorporated into the ontology?

---

## 4. Semantic and Ontological Features
- Are there specific dimensions (e.g., spatial, temporal, frequency) that are critical in your domain?

---

## 5. Domain-Specific Knowledge and Insights
- How do you validate or verify knowledge derived from or associated with time series data?
- Are there specific terminologies, classifications, or ontologies already in use in your domain that should be integrated?
- Do you need the ontology to support inferred knowledge or only capture explicitly provided information?

---

## 6. Validation and Evaluation
- How would you evaluate whether the ontology effectively captures your domain-specific knowledge?
- Are there specific scenarios or datasets in your domain that you would use to test the ontology?

---

## 7. Closing Questions
- Is there anything else you would like the ontology to achieve for your domain?
- Do you foresee any challenges in adopting this ontology in your workflows?
