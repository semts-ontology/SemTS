# Interview Template Version 3: Semantic Web Experts

This version is tailored for semantic web experts to understand their expectations regarding design, structure, and integration.

---

## 1. General Understanding and Use Cases
- What are the primary use cases you envision for the SemTS ontology?
- How would you describe the importance of semantic representation for time series information and knowledge?
- Are there any existing ontologies or standards that you believe SemTS should align with?

---

## 2. Ontology Design and Structure
- How should the ontology represent time series sequences and their relationships (e.g., hierarchical, overlapping)?
- Do you recommend any specific standards, such as OWL-Time or DCAT, for representing temporal and data elements?
- Are there any further specific semantic standards or ontologies (e.g., ML-Schema, OWL-Time) that should be incorporated?
- Are there any best practices for representing data-specific details in an ontology?
- What could be useful vocabularies?

---

## 3. Knowledge Categorization and Representation
- How would you structure knowledge categorization?
- Should the ontology support inferred knowledge, explicitly provided knowledge, or both?
- How can we best represent the provenance of knowledge?
- What level of granularity is required for representing knowledge associated with time series segments?

---

## 4. Validation and Evaluation
- How would you validate the correctness and completeness of the ontology?
- Are there specific tools or methodologies you would recommend for evaluating the ontology?
- What competency questions should the ontology be able to answer?

---

## 5. Closing Questions
- Are there any specific challenges you foresee in designing or maintaining the ontology?
- Is there anything else you would like the ontology to address or achieve?
